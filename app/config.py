"""Secret contract for ops-engine-x.

Auth foundation is inherited from `aux_m2m_server.BaseAuthSettings` —
backends do not redeclare AUX_* fields. Backend-specific secrets are
declared below as either tier-1 (boot-required) or tier-2 (lazy/optional).

Tier-1 secrets — boot-required (validated by Pydantic at module import):
    AUX_JWKS_URL, AUX_ISSUER, AUX_AUDIENCE
    AUX_M2M_API_KEY, AUX_API_BASE_URL  (this backend's own M2M identity)
        — all five inherited from BaseAuthSettings.

Tier-2 secrets — lazy, fail at call site if needed but unset:
    OPEX_DB_URL_POOLED / OPEX_DB_URL_DIRECT  (Postgres DSNs)
    OPEX_SUPABASE_*                          (reserved)
    MAGS_API_BASE_URL / SERX_API_BASE_URL / OEX_API_BASE_URL
        (outbound base URLs only — auth is M2M JWT via aux_m2m_client,
         not service-specific bearers)

ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is **not** held by this project. All Anthropic traffic
flows through managed-agents-x. Do not add it to this project's Doppler.

Doppler project: `ops-engine-x`, config `prd`. AUX_* values are also
syncable from `shared-services` for cross-service consistency.
